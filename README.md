## Description
This project is a timed quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript. The user has 60 seconds to answer 5 multiple-choice questions. Every correct answer scores the user 10 pts; an incorrect answer will subtract 10 seconds from the timer. When time runs out or all questions are answered, the user may enter their initials to submit their score to a locally stored leaderboard.

## Results
* Through this project, I gained an understanding of local storage.
* I learned the importance of pseudo-coding & thoughtfully mapping out logic/structure before starting a project.
* I also expanded my knowledge of CSS and how to create a better UI/UX.
